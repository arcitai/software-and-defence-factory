# factory-evaluate

Read the project's agreed evaluation cases, inputs and verification criteria. Freeze model/version, harness/version, worker resources, tools, context, limits and input revision; preserve an input digest. Give the implementer only the designated fixture and case; keep private expected results with the verifier. When evaluating the Arcitai starter itself, its optional evals/suite.json and evals/oracle.md provide these inputs. An adopted app does not need those files or that runtime.

Include the factory revision and the actual workflow/prompt/skill versions in the private evidence artifact. A change to these inputs is a different configuration even if the model name stays the same. Start with an explicit hypothesis; use matched inputs to assess it. For best-of-N, retain every candidate and charge the selection/review work to the cohort. Do not let a worker edit its own evaluation or automatically adopt a proposed skill change.

Use at least three repetitions per case/configuration for the pilot comparison. Keep failures, timeouts and capability blocks. Record inference, review-model and compute cost, allocation assumptions, active time, human review minutes and reproducible artifacts. Unknown is null, not zero. Mark estimates explicitly.

An independent reviewer applies the agreed rubric, including whether the requested behavior actually works. Preserve results in the project's chosen artifact or report format. For the optional Arcitai evaluation dashboard, use its four-criterion rubric and scripts/import-evaluation.mjs; that importer validates format and duplicate identity, not reviewer authenticity or the truth of evidence.

Compare only matched case/repetition cohorts. Show acceptance rate and total cost per accepted result alongside human time, per-case variation and missed/false security findings. Do not use the operational demo, tokens/second or a single judge score as a claim of business ROI.
