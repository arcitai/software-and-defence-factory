# Factory Foundation: repository and execution setup

The operator skill is available through `software-defence-factory foundation`.
See [Factory concepts](concepts.md) for host, worker, harness and agent roles.

Use this plan for a new installation or when moving an existing Factory to a
execution host. Complete the applicable checkpoints in order and record the
result in a **private** copy of the checklist below. The plan applies to any
operator/worker names and any suitable private network; it requires no personal
context system, particular VPN provider or Factory source checkout.

The operator owns access and infrastructure choices. Factory maintainers own
this plan and the linked command guides and update them with behavior changes.
Paths beginning `/private/state` or `/absolute/path` below are placeholders;
replace them with user-owned absolute directories outside the application and
installed package.

## 1. Choose the scope and hosts

| Choice | Record before installation |
| --- | --- |
| Method only or runtime | Method export needs no Docker, background service or model |
| Operator/client | Local machine, user and how the dashboard will be opened |
| Execution host | Linux/systemd for managed controllers; macOS can use manual `up` |
| Applications | Canonical repository, branch, preserved WIP and responsible owner |
| Runtime | Stable Node executable (22.13+), Git, Docker, CPU/RAM/disk budget |
| State | Private state path and unused loopback port for each installation |
| Inference | Provider/model, credential reference, job image and network path |
| Automation | Which controllers may start, update policy and who may submit work |
| Recovery | Private backup location, retained runtime/image and recovery contact |

One installation owns one repository and port. A synthetic qualification
installation can provide a running dashboard while product controllers remain
stopped. There is no multi-project controller or second scheduler hidden in
this plan. Keep unrelated personal agent configuration on its existing host.

For method-only adoption, run `software-defence-factory kit --output NEW_DIRECTORY`
and follow [the adoption guide](../kit/README.md). The remaining host/runtime
steps apply only when using Factory's optional controller.

## 2. Establish host access and boot prerequisites

Use an unprivileged operator account. Check `node --version`, `git --version`
and `docker info` from the actual login/SSH session. Install dependencies using
the host's supported method. For a Linux worker, Docker, SSH and any private
network client must start at boot; inspect their actual unit names instead of
assuming every distribution uses the same service names.

For remote access:

1. Establish a reachable private address, including across networks if needed.
2. Enroll the worker's verified SSH host key and configure key authentication.
3. Create an SSH alias such as `factory-worker`; verify
   `ssh -o BatchMode=yes factory-worker 'id -un'` from the operator machine.
4. Verify firewall/interface scope. Keep the dashboard on loopback; do not
   expose it publicly or disable host-key checking to make the tunnel work.

Administrator access is a separate host choice. Installing/running Factory user
services does **not** require root or unrestricted passwordless sudo. If the
owner deliberately chooses passwordless administration, inspect `sudo -n -l`
for the intended `NOPASSWD` policy and repeat the permitted command after a
fresh reboot. A successful `sudo -n` command can merely reuse cached
credentials. A missing rule must be installed by an authenticated administrator;
record that remaining step without blocking unprivileged Factory operation.

Record disk unlock, login and power behavior explicitly. Linux user lingering
can start services without desktop login **after the OS and home are available**;
it cannot unlock an encrypted disk. A sleeping laptop is not an available
worker. Choose AC/battery/sleep behavior with the owner; do not disable disk
security or change power policy as a side effect of Factory setup.

Checkpoint: noninteractive SSH (when needed), Docker and the chosen Node binary
work, and required host dependencies have a documented startup/recovery owner.

## 3. Install the package and qualify the runtime

```sh
npm install --global software-defence-factory
software-defence-factory --version
software-defence-factory help
```

Use a user-writable npm prefix or the existing Node manager; do not turn the
controller into a root process to work around installation permissions. For
example, Linux users choosing `--prefix "$HOME/.local"` must also make
`$HOME/.local/bin` available in their login PATH. `npx` uses the same package;
managed services retain a runtime outside its cache. Keep the service's recorded
Node executable available. See [installation and updates](npm.md).

Use a **separate synthetic state and unused port** to exercise the runtime:

```sh
software-defence-factory demo --state /private/state/runtime-proof --port 7345
# Inspect and finish the sample handoff before qualification.
software-defence-factory qualify --state /private/state/runtime-proof
```

These commands deliberately create synthetic jobs, including failed/interrupted
attempts. Never use application state for `demo` or `qualify`. They make no model
calls and prove neither model quality nor application readiness. Preserve the
qualification record; stop this controller unless it is the selected dashboard.

## 4. Prepare each application and inference profile

Preserve existing commits, branches, uncommitted work and licenses before moving
anything. Verify the canonical Git origin and main branch's tracking target;
a fork may still track its upstream product. Move application sources into the
chosen workspace, not into the npm package or private runtime state.

Use [repository readiness](../kit/repository.md) for issue forms, labels, CI
policy and the explicit issue-to-job handoff. A ready label does not start a job.

Before admitting development work, establish:

- Reproducible toolchain/dependency pins and an actual build/check command.
- A compatible job image for native libraries, browser/mobile tools or custom
  model adapters; the standard image does not supply every application stack.
- Meaningful checks in the selected CI on the selected revision, plus the intended
  review/branch policy. Record plan/access limits if enforcement is unavailable.
- Applicable application instructions, design/scope, resource limits, secret
  references and a clear delivery destination. Keep unfinished WIP separate
  until intentionally integrated; jobs clone committed source only.

Configure a new installation using [the quickstart](quickstart.md):

```sh
software-defence-factory init --repo /absolute/path/to/app --harness pi --check "npm ci && npm test" --state /private/state/my-app --port 7331
software-defence-factory install --state /private/state/my-app
software-defence-factory doctor --state /private/state/my-app
```

Replace the harness/check/paths with the accepted application profile. Plain
`install` builds the standard image. To use an application-specific image, build
it on the worker first and select its existing local tag instead:

```sh
software-defence-factory install --image LOCAL_IMAGE_REF --state /private/state/my-app
```

This command checks the local Docker daemon, records and retains the exact image
ID, and does not download or build the selected image. Stop the installation and
reconcile every job before changing its image. Running plain `install` later
still rebuilds and selects the standard image. `init` does not edit the app,
install personal skills or submit a task. Runtime jobs receive the bundled
method and six skills automatically.

For a local model, verify the existing model service, intended model name and
its startup. Test the model API from a disposable container using the **selected
job image and network**. Host `127.0.0.1` inside a container is not the host's
loopback. Any host bridge/proxy and narrow firewall rule are explicit machine
infrastructure; they need their own startup and reboot checks. A bridge address may appear
after the user service manager starts; configure retry/readiness and verify
recovery rather than assuming startup order from enablement alone. Avoid duplicate
model servers, public listeners, Docker socket mounts or whole account folders.
Cloud inference likewise needs a real provider/model connectivity check without
printing credentials. A model-list/health response is connectivity evidence;
qualifying model output requires a separately accepted bounded task.

Checkpoint: record the exact source revision, image ID, check command, resource
limits, inference connectivity and CI result. Keep product controllers stopped
until their tasks are explicitly ready to run.

## 5. Enable only the intended background services

A newly initialized state has no jobs. Before adopting older state, establish
that its queue may resume; starting **any** controller executes queued work.
If queue ownership/state is uncertain, reconcile it before enabling autostart.

On the Linux worker, select the state that should stay available:

```sh
software-defence-factory stop --state /private/state/runtime-proof
software-defence-factory service install --state /private/state/runtime-proof
software-defence-factory service status --state /private/state/runtime-proof
software-defence-factory service updates --auto on
software-defence-factory service updates --auto status
```

Follow [services](services.md) for user lingering, existing Docker group
membership, logs, stop/start, uninstall and maintenance recovery. A user manager
started before Docker group membership changed may need `--group docker`; this
applies an existing group and grants no new membership. Enable lingering only
for the intended account through the host's administrator.

On the operator machine, stop any old manual tunnel, then:

```sh
software-defence-factory tunnel install --host factory-worker --port 7345
software-defence-factory tunnel status --host factory-worker --port 7345
```

Use the actual selected dashboard port on both sides. macOS tunnels start at
user login; Linux uses its user service manager. Open `http://127.0.0.1:7345`.
This is the worker's loopback dashboard forwarded through SSH.

Managed daily updates reserve idle controllers and preserve the prior running
set; they defer when busy and attempt rollback if the new runtime is unhealthy.
A deliberate `service stop` leaves boot enablement in place: use `uninstall`
when a controller must also remain disabled across reboots. Preserve private
state and previous releases. The timer does not rebuild application images,
start product tasks, change a model or publish application changes.

## 6. Prove reboot recovery and hand over

Choose a reboot window with disk unlock/recovery available. Save a private
baseline of the boot ID (`cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`), runtime version,
job IDs/states/attempts, selected enabled services and paused installations.
After the owner reboots/unlocks the worker, check **before manually starting
anything**:

- SSH returns and a changed boot ID confirms a new boot.
- Docker, private network and model/proxy services are healthy, with no relevant
  failed units or repeated restart loop. Inspect their current-boot logs.
- `service status --state PATH` reports enabled/running/healthy, the intended
  runtime version and no unexpected maintenance reservation.
- The update timer is enabled and has a next execution time.
- The operator's tunnel reconnects and the dashboard responds at the same URL.
- Job history is unchanged and intentionally disabled product controllers have
  no listeners or executor processes. Probe model connectivity from the job
  container again without starting a product agent.
- The intended administrator policy still works, if that capability was chosen.

Record actual observations and failures separately. An observed boot after
manual unlock/login does not prove an unattended cold boot; a worker reboot
does not prove operator-machine login startup. Process crash recovery and tests
across two physical networks are also distinct checks. Use [recovery](recovery.md)
and [service recovery](services.md#recovery-and-proof-limits) for failures; do not
start a second controller or clear unknown process locks to make status green.

Copy this private completion record into the installation's handoff:

| Checkpoint | Result | Evidence / remaining action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host roles, owner, source and private state selected | Pending | |
| SSH, Docker, Node and host startup prerequisites | Pending | |
| Synthetic runtime qualification | Pending | |
| Application image, real checks/CI and preserved WIP | Pending | |
| Inference path and chosen model | Pending | |
| Controller/tunnel/timer installation and recovery | Pending | |
| Worker reboot after required unlock/login | Pending | |
| Operator login recovery / separate networks | Pending | Record separately |
| History and intentionally stopped products preserved | Pending | |
| Backups, logs, stop/update/rollback owner and guide | Pending | |
| First bounded application task | Not started | Separate task authority and proof |

Use Pass, Fail or Not applicable with a reason; never infer success from an
installed file. Keep host identities, credentials, raw logs and customer details
out of public issues and package contents. A ready worker is only the foundation:
follow [the method](../kit/README.md#first-real-task) for the first explicitly
accepted application task and revision-bound checks/review/handoff.
