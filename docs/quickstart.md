# Runtime quickstart

For a new execution host or remote operator, start with the [setup plan](setup.md).

Install Node 22.13+, Git and Docker Engine/Desktop. Use an unprivileged account with Docker access. Install `software-defence-factory` through npm, or invoke the same package with npx. No factory source checkout is required.

## Qualify a synthetic installation

```sh
software-defence-factory demo
```

Open the printed localhost URL, inspect the sample task and its files, then approve the handoff. This changes only an isolated synthetic repository and makes no inference calls. Once the sample finishes:

```sh
software-defence-factory qualify --state /absolute/path/printed/by/demo
```

The qualification intentionally creates failed, cancelled and interrupted tasks. They are expected evidence of failure handling. Never point qualification at an application installation.

## Connect an application

Commit an intentional, reviewed starting point in the application first. Jobs clone committed code only; uncommitted work stays in the source checkout.

```sh
software-defence-factory init --repo /absolute/path/to/app --harness codex --check "npm ci && npm test" --source-ref main --state /private/state/my-app --port 7331
software-defence-factory install --state /private/state/my-app
software-defence-factory doctor --state /private/state/my-app
```

`init --source-ref` selects the configured default ref (`HEAD` when omitted). Each job resolves that ref, or an explicit `--source-ref` on `run`/`issue start`, in the configured repository and durably retains its commit before acknowledging admission. The CLI and dashboard show the requested ref and resolved SHA. Task text and reference links do not select a repository or ref.

Verification commands receive `FACTORY_BASE_REVISION`, the resolved admission commit recorded as the candidate base. Diff-based checks should compare against this revision; the isolated checkout has no origin remote. The value comes from protected controller metadata, not the task text.

Replace the check with the application's actual verification command. `init` does not edit the app, copy global skills or start work. It creates factory.json, worker.token and model.env with private permissions. Each installation has one repository and a distinct state path/port. `--harness pi` selects Pi; `--harness custom --command-json '["executable","argument"]'` selects an available command in the job image. The bundled image provides Node, Git, Codex and Pi. Other toolchains require an intentionally built compatible image; do not claim Rust/mobile/browser capabilities from this image alone.

Configure inference credentials in the private model.env file. Do not copy the operator's entire account environment or authentication folders. Codex uses its supported API credential environment; Pi uses the selected provider's configuration. Use `--model` with init for a specific model. Task-level model overrides are supported only for Codex/Pi and do not prove that the provider serves that model.

A local model endpoint must be reachable from inside the job container. Host loopback addresses do not automatically refer to the host from Docker. Configure and qualify the chosen adapter/network path before dispatch; this package does not automatically expose Ollama or import its models.

```sh
software-defence-factory up --state /private/state/my-app
software-defence-factory run --file task.md --source-ref main --state /private/state/my-app
```

A task should describe the accepted outcome, allowed scope and observable checks. The CLI also accepts `--issue https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123` for an issue belonging to the configured origin; it uses the operator's existing gh access outside the job. The dashboard supports the same task workflow. Source text and links do not grant additional authority.

## Review and handoff

Inspect the task's Result, Files and History tabs. Task details show the requested source ref, resolved admission SHA and previous source commits when a new base was selected. Build evidence includes candidate.json, change.patch and the implementation report; handoff records its source SHA. Checks and review identify their exact candidate commit and policy hash. Approval revalidates both before writing accepted.json. Request changes preserves the recorded source by default and starts fresh checks/review; an explicit new source ref is retained as a deliberate base change.

The source application is not changed and no branch, PR, merge or deployment is published automatically. A reviewed change.patch can be checked and applied with `git apply --check` and `git apply` on an appropriate branch at its recorded base revision; then follow the application's normal integrated checks and delivery policy.

## Remote access and operation

```sh
ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:7331:127.0.0.1:7331 your-host
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:7331 on the client. Use the same local/remote port because the HTTP service validates its Host header. The SSH connection must remain open. Access also works across different networks when your configured private network connects the hosts.

Use `status`, `cancel JOB_ID`, `retry JOB_ID` and `stop`, always with the selected `--state`. `service install --state PATH` installs and enables the supported Linux user service; `service status`, `service logs` and `service uninstall` operate it. Bare `service` only prints a definition. For managed startup, persistent SSH tunnels and daily idle updates, follow [services](services.md). See [recovery](recovery.md) for interrupted attempts.

## Native application builds

Build a compatible application image on the execution host, then select its existing
local tag through the CLI:

```sh
software-defence-factory install --image LOCAL_IMAGE_REF --state /private/state/my-app
software-defence-factory doctor --state /private/state/my-app
```

Selection resolves and retains the immutable image ID. It does not pull or build
the reference. An unavailable image, a running controller, an unreconciled job
or a remaining job container makes selection fail without changing the last
working configuration. Plain `install` remains the standard-image build path
and selects the standard image again. `doctor` verifies that the recorded image
metadata matches the image selected in private state; it reports model and
toolchain qualification separately, and does not perform either qualification.

In `factory.json`, `cpus` (1–32, default 2), `pidsLimit` (64–16384, default 256), `memoryMiB` and
`timeoutSeconds` bound the job's resources. Verification uses a separate
disk-backed checkout, keeping the candidate read-only. Its private scratch
directory is removed after container termination is confirmed. Interrupted
executors may retain scratch under their attempt for recovery; stop/reconcile
the job before removing it. Ensure the state filesystem has sufficient space.
No Docker socket, operator credentials or unrelated project caches are mounted.


## Read the project dashboard

Inbox contains both Software delivery and Defence investigation. Select a
workflow to focus the list; workflow, requested-model, status-badge and text
filters combine. Analytics offers the same workflow separation for recorded
outcomes, duration and [token usage](usage.md). An issue link is a reference,
not an execution type. For validated, deduplicated private incident intake,
use the [Defence integration](defence-integration.md) recipe; the generic
Defence form is not that typed intake path.

The header names the configured project. View repo opens a validated GitHub
origin. New issue opens Factory’s local chooser: repository templates, a blank
form or existing GitHub issues. Create issue saves to the supported repository provider without execution. Start work queues local work. See [intake and CLI examples](workflows.md). The task detail provides previous/next within the filtered list, copy
link and close (Escape). Closing preserves the list's filters and position.

If the interface looks unexpectedly small, check the browser zoom. The design
is tested at 100%; changing browser zoom is separate from a project theme.

## Environment

Factory does not load a repository `.env` file. Configure the private
`factory.json` through `init`; put inference credentials only in its private
`model.env`. A repository `.env.example` is unnecessary for this CLI. Optional
process settings are `SDF_AUTO_UPDATE=0` (skip automatic CLI update checks),
`XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (user-owned state, release
and service locations). They must be exported in the process environment.
Legacy prototype names such as `FACTORY_WORKER_CONFIG`, `FACTORY_MODEL`, `PORT`
and `FACTORY_DEMO` are not supported. See [concepts](concepts.md).
