# One runtime, CLI and dashboard

Issue [#37](https://github.com/arcitai/software-and-defence-factory/issues/37)
owns complete bidirectional capability parity. This inventory records current
gaps; it is not a claim that parity is complete. Keep it current in each relevant
change. The queue/controller owns task state, policy and acceptance in both
interfaces. Host operations need a deliberate operator API, never an arbitrary
shell endpoint or a second scheduler.

| Capability | CLI | Shared API | Dashboard | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project/queue/attempt state | `status` JSON | `GET /api/v1/status` | Project, tasks, details/history | Stable versioned agent result/error contract |
| Submit software text | `run --file` | `POST /api/v1/jobs` | New task | Equivalent title/source/model options and validation |
| Import a GitHub issue | `run --issue` via operator `gh` | No issue import/list endpoint | Text/link input only | Backlog, explicit admission and issue/job identity; no implicit polling |
| Cancel/retry/approve | Commands | Job action endpoints with current run ID | Task controls | JSON action results and consistent needs-attention outcomes |
| Request changes | `revise --file` | `request_changes` action | Feedback form | JSON action result; retain shared stale-action guards |
| Remove a stopped task | No command | `DELETE /api/v1/jobs/:id` | Remove action | Add CLI; keep existing recoverability/history semantics |
| Evidence list/read/download | No command | Authenticated artifact routes | Files/preview/download | Add CLI with matching access and size/path rules |
| Workflow definitions | No command | `GET /api/v1/definitions` | Workflows | Add structured CLI inspection |
| Analytics/filtering | Raw status available | Source queue records | Derived views | Expose equivalent queries/summaries without inventing usage data |
| Scoped incident admission | `incident --file` validates/deduplicates private evidence | No equivalent typed intake endpoint | Generic Defence form is not equivalent admission | Common typed intake, gaps and deduplication before execution |
| Initialize/configure | `init` | No operator setup endpoint | None | Preserve app files, explicit state and private secrets |
| Select/install job image | `install [--image LOCAL_REF]` (#30) | No operator image endpoint | None | Shared supported controls after host-operation boundary; runtime checks alone do not qualify a toolchain/model |
| Diagnostics | `doctor` | Limited status/definitions only | Runtime status only | Equivalent checks/results and truthful qualification status |
| Controller lifecycle | `up`, `stop`, `serve`, `service` | Operator-only maintenance reservation | No lifecycle controls | Define safe behavior while stopped/restarting; GUI must not bypass maintenance |
| Runtime updates | `update`, `service update`, auto-update settings | No update endpoint | None | Idle-only activation, rollback and common progress/errors |
| SSH tunnels | `tunnel` | No tunnel endpoint | None | Client-host ownership; distinguish operator machine from worker |
| Method export | `kit --output` | No export endpoint | None | Equivalent download/export preserving staging-only adoption |
| Synthetic qualification | `demo`, `qualify` | No qualification endpoint | Synthetic disclosure only | Explicit separate state; never target an application accidentally |
| Immutable source admission | Controlled-checkout workaround | Not implemented | Not implemented | #28, same recorded source in both interfaces |
| Trusted PR handoff | Operator applies accepted patch | Not implemented | Not implemented | #29; credentials remain outside jobs |

The current generic task form can name the Defence workflow; that is not a
substitute for the CLI's validated incident admission. Treat the typed intake
gap as unfinished functionality, not a qualified human workflow.

Implement the smaller task/evidence/JSON gaps first. Setup/lifecycle controls
need an operator boundary that remains usable when a project controller is
stopped, preserves least privilege and cannot expose host commands to task text.
Do not equate the browser's current project session with host administrator
authority. Headless use and GUI use must ultimately reach the same outcomes;
intermediate releases must explicitly retain their unimplemented rows here.
