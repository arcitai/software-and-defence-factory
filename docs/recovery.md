# Recovery and retained evidence

Use `status --state PATH` and the private supervisor.log to identify the active installation. Stop it before replacing its package or container image.

- A normal `stop` signals the controller, waits for the executor process group, removes its labelled containers and retains the database and artifacts.
- An unconfirmed running attempt becomes `interrupted` on controller restart. It is never silently considered successful.
- `retry JOB_ID` reconciles the previous process group and containers. A live or unknown writer blocks retry. For a new build/defence attempt, the prior checkout is retained as previous-checkout-*.
- A failed verification can retry the same unchanged candidate after the check environment is repaired. A changed candidate needs a fresh verification/review sequence.
- A requested revision retains previous evidence and starts a new build from the source repository with the accumulated feedback. It does not reuse earlier approval.
- Removing a stopped task from the dashboard hides its queue record. Private artifacts and its deleted_at record remain on disk; this is not secure erasure.

Do not remove active.json merely to unblock a job. Establish that its PID, process group and labelled containers are stopped. PID reuse or missing process identity requires operator investigation. Preserve logs and work before cleanup.

For backup, stop the installation and copy the complete private state directory, including SQLite files, factory.json and credentials, to an authorized private destination. Restore only while stopped. Update the repository path if it moved, verify ownership/permissions and the pinned image, then inspect state before any retry. Keep previous backups; no automatic destructive schema migration is provided.

Earlier experimental engines use a different journal. Start a new state directory for the native 0.3 runtime; preserve old journals separately. There is no automatic import of their jobs or approval state.

Verification cleanup makes owned scratch directories traversable before removing
them and never follows their symlinks. It runs only after container stop is
confirmed. If a filesystem error still prevents cleanup, the attempt fails and
retains the original check exit and private log path alongside the cleanup error.
Inspect that retained attempt before manual removal; never substitute the source
candidate path for the scratch path.

## Review feedback or phase retry

Use **Request changes** on a failed software review only when its validated
verdict is `changes` or `blocked`, or at the normal approval gate. The CLI
provides the same action:

```sh
software-defence-factory revise JOB_ID --file /private/revision.md --state /private/state/project
```

Feedback must be nonempty and at most 4,000 characters. It is accumulated in the
bounded job prompt. The controller checks the latest attempt and reconciles its
processes before starting a new build from the configured source with that
feedback. The old checkout moves to `previous-checkout-*`; the old failed review
and reports remain intact. Verification, review and operator approval are all
required again. A stale or duplicate request cannot approve or restart a newer
attempt. **Retry** only repeats the stopped phase and is suitable for a repaired
execution environment; retrying review cannot change the candidate.

A crashed review without a validated verdict cannot request implementation
changes. Inspect the private log and restore the missing runtime capability
before retrying. For pre-0.4.3 jobs, the controller can recognize a failed review
only from that attempt's retained `review.json`, matching the candidate and
successful check policy. Missing or mismatched evidence grants no revision action.
Do not edit SQLite, rewrite verdicts or create acceptance records to bypass this.

## Bounded diagnostics

Each attempt's private `<phase>.log` retains the first 128 KiB and last 768 KiB
of observed Docker stdout/stderr. A truncation marker identifies omitted bytes;
the footer records process exit code, signal and stream byte counts. UTF-8 is
decoded separately per pipe; interleaving reflects observed arrival order, not a
guarantee of ordering between pipes. Inspect `artifacts/<run>/executor.log` and
`result.json` for controller/adapter failures as well. Raw model logs remain
private: do not paste them into public issues without sanitizing them.

A terminal log line is diagnostic evidence, not a replacement for required
agent reports, passing checks or review. Nonzero exits and missing/malformed
reports still fail closed. Process termination during a host crash can leave
incomplete logs and an interrupted attempt; apply process reconciliation above.

## Recorded execution profiles

Before each attempt executes, the controller freezes its effective configuration
and resolves the Docker image tag to an immutable image ID. The private
`<run>/execution-config.json` is mode 0600 and is not a dashboard artifact. Its
command can contain private operator configuration; preserve it only in private
backups. The inference environment remains private and is never exported.

The allowlisted `artifacts/<run>/execution.json`, measurement and dashboard
agree on executor, requested model, controller version, immutable image and
policy hash. This hash fingerprints the effective runtime configuration JSON; it
is not the SHA-256 of the mounted `policy.md` file. Verification and handoff are deterministic and have no model;
handoff has no job container. Mock executions also have no model; arbitrary
custom commands have unknown model selection rather than a fabricated provider
default. Only supported Codex/Pi profiles record a configured model request.
A requested model is configuration, not independent
proof of the model/provider that served inference. Changing the installation's
profile affects subsequent attempts, never the recorded history. A changed
check/review policy still invalidates acceptance of earlier proof.

Attempts made before this metadata existed display **Not recorded
(legacy/unknown)**. Do not copy today's profile onto them. For an investigation,
compare the retained per-attempt measurement, logs, candidate/check/review hashes
and any contemporaneous private configuration backup. Record only corroborated
facts in a separate private incident note with evidence paths and unknowns; leave
the original queue/evidence unchanged. Without that evidence, model/image facts
cannot be reconstructed reliably.

### Interrupted image selection or controller startup

`installation.lock` serializes image changes with controller startup, including
managed boot/restarts. A live supervisor then prevents image changes while work
can run. If an operation is interrupted, preserve the lock and inspect its PID
and action. Remove it only after confirming that process and its image build or
startup have stopped, then run `doctor` and reconcile image metadata before
starting again. The CLI does not automatically clear an unknown lock.
